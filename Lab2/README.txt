Our submission for Lab 2 is a fully-functional 4-bit ALU with 16 modes. The ALU outputs to a decoder which can, depending on user input, display either the 3 number hex instruction code or the decimal output to the Artix-7 7-segment display.


The ALU features a new carry look-ahead adder, and several necessary extra modules (e.g.  multiplexors) are also included. Further included with these files are testbenches for the full system, ALU, 7-segment decoder, and carry look-ahead adder.
